# Basic Development Training

## Introduction
This training is designed to accommodate participants with a little to no experience with programming.
It is intended to get anybody who is (or will be) practicing software development to a minimum baseline skill-set.

## Focus Areas
* Benefits of programming
* Good practices
* Variables
* Types
* Text
* Functions
* Scope
* Branching
* Looping
* Arrays
* Data Structures
* File I/O
* Debugging
* Error Handling
* Testing
* Responsibilities

## Leaders
Leaders will:
* Be supportive
* Check in on the screenshares every so often to make sure that nobody is getting stuck / too far behind
* Run through the same lessons as the participants at least once to gain familiarity of the material
* Manage the transition between working on the lessons, and round-robin demoing of the projects

## Participants
Participants will:
* Complete the scheduled activities to the best of their abilities
* Complete the homework activities to the best of their abilities / resources

## Learning Python
We will be following the [Codecademy Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python) course.
This schedule is designed around 5 participants.

Python has been chosen for this course for the following reasons:
1. It is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that we can use it to teach object-oriented and functional concepts.
2. It features built-in memory management and dynamic typing, reducing the learning curve for the language.
3. It is supported by AWS Lambda, and has a mature native AWS SDK library.
4. Its syntax is not too 'out there' for basic functionality. This translates to a knowledge of python being a good grounding for other languages.

The [Udemy Complete Python](https://www.udemy.com/python-complete/) course has had good feedback from people learning Python.
However, it is much less interactive, with a focus on videos (which you may prefer), and there is a charge for the course.
If after the Codecademy course, you do not feel like you have a good grounding in Python, then discuss with your manager about taking the Udemy course.
